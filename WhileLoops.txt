A while loop is basically a repeating if statement.
A while loop can count numbers
int i = 1;
	while (condition) 
	{
		Console.WriteLine (i);
		i++;
	}
if a while loop does not include an increment then the loop will continue forever
a while loop starts with while
while()
	{
	}
++ means add 1 to the original number
(int >,<,<=,=<,!= int)
break is important to get out of the loop without performing the whole condition
A while loop repeats a section of code while a certain condition is specified and seen as true
Condition goes inside parenthesis after while
