Arrays are a way to store a collection of ints together.
int[]
an array uses open and close brackets []
type[] nameOfArray = new type[number of elements];
nameOfArray[index of element to access] = value;
index of an element is an integer with the first index being zero
first element = index 0
second element = index 1
a way to wite the array in one line:
	type[] nameOfArray = {value, value, value, value, value};
Arrays work really well with loops
The default value of a numeric array is zero and reference elements are set to null
